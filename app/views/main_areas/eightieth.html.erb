<h1>Mu Theta 80th Anniversary</h1>


<p>
	A black tie banquet celebrating the 80th anniversary of the Mu Theta Chapter of the Zeta Psi Fraternity of North America.
</p>

<p>
	We've been celebrating in Tau Kappa Phi from 1930 - 2010. Now it's time to honour this achievement in the same hall where we began so many years ago.	With the Honourable James Wheatley as Master of Ceremony, and a variety of speakers and presentations, we will remember the amazing accomplishments of our chapter. This will be the event they talk about for the next 80 years.
