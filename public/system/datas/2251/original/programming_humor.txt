"The three most dangerous things in the world are a programmer with a
soldering iron, a hardware type with a program patch and a user with an idea."
- _The Wizardry Compiled_ by Rick Cook

"The primary purpose of the DATA statement is to give names to constants; instead of
referring to pi as 3.141592653589793 at every appearance, the variable PI can be given
that value with a DATA statement and used instead of the longer form of the constant.
This also simplifies modifying the program, should the value of pi change."
- FORTRAN manual for Xerox computers

"Never put off until run time what you can do at compile time."
- David Gries, in "Compiler Construction for Digital Computers", circa 1969.

Any sufficiently advanced bug is indistinguishable from a feature. 

Programming is 10% science, 25% ingenuity and 65% getting the ingenuity to work with the science.

>>>  The computer is mightier than the pen, the sword, and usually the programmer.	***

>>>  Programming is an art form that fights back.

If at first you don't succeed, you must be a programmer.   ***

"It's 5:50 a.m., Do you know where your stack pointer is?"

There are two ways to write error-free programs; only the third one works.

Deliver yesterday, code today, think tomorrow.  ***

Programming is a lot like sex. One mistake and you could have to support it the rest of your life.

Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of APL, I shall fear
no evil, for I can string six primitive monadic and dyadic operators together.

"I think there is a world market for maybe five computers."
- Thomas Watson, chairman of IBM, 1943.

"640K ought to be enough for anybody."
-Bill Gates, 1981 

"I've never met a human being who would want to read 17,000 pages of
documentation, and if there was, I'd kill him to get him out of the gene pool."
- Joseph Costello, President of Cadence

Hardware: A product that if you play with it long enough, breaks.
Software: A product that if you play with it long enough, works. 

Users: Collective term for those who stare vacently at a monitor. Users
         are divided into three Types: Novice, Intermediate and Expert.

Novice Users: People who are afraid that simply pressing a key might break their computer.  
Intermediate Users: People who don't know how to fix their computer after pressing a key that broke it.
Expert Users: People who break other people's computers.    

If a program is useful, it must be changed.        ***
If a program is useless, it must be documented.
If a program runs right, it must be obsolete.      

Hardware: The parts of a computer system that can be kicked.

make it idiot proof and someone will make a better idiot.

 Error, no keyboard - press F1 to continue.

There's too much blood in my caffeine system.

 Artificial Intelligence usually beats real stupidity.

 Ever notice how fast Windows runs?  Neither did I.


"Very funny, Scotty.  Now beam down my clothes."

 Oops.  My brain just hit a bad sector.

 Multitasking:  Screwing up several things at once...

 Computer analyst to programmer: "You start coding.  I'll go find out what they want."

 According to my calculations the problem doesn't exist.

 >>>  This time it will surely run.  ****

>>>  I just found the last bug.  ****

 The generation of random numbers is too important to be left to chance.

 If  debugging is the process of removing bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in.         -Dykstra


Logic:   The art of being wrong with confidence...   ****

To iterate is human; to recurse, divine.

>>>   If at first you don't succeed, call it version 1.0   ****

Maintenance-free:  When it breaks, it can't be fixed...

Good programming is 99% sweat and 1% coffee.

In theory there is no difference between theory and practice. But, in practice, there is.
